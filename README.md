# Fluorescence of Amoxicillin Reader Example

The purpose of this repository is develop a theoretical framework purposed in a [blog post][link1] for the determination of the presence of drugs in cells. The calculations will preformed on open source fluorescence microscopy images in a format as similar as what I can tell will be used in a real world, in vitro scenario. The list of image sources can be found in this repository in the notebooks folder in the first notebook.

Some basic image processing was done including resizing all images to the same size and separating out the color into their respective RBG components. An example of this data can be seen below in Figure 1.
