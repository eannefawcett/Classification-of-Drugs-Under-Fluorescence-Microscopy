# Fluorescence of Amoxicillin Reader Example

The purpose of this repository is develop a theoretical framework purposed in a [blog post][link1] for the determination of the presence of drugs in cells. The calculations will preformed on open source fluorescence microscopy images in a format as similar as what I can tell will be used in a real world, in vitro scenario. The list of image sources can be found in this repository in the notebooks folder in the first notebook.
